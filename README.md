# AQUARIUS
Aquarius (♒︎) (Greek: Ὑδροχόος, romanized: Hydrokhóos, Latin for "water-bearer") is the eleventh astrological sign in the zodiac, originating from the constellation Aquarius. Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun is in the Aquarius sign between about January 20 and February 18.[2] Aquarius is one of the three air signs, alongside Gemini and Libra. The ruling planets of Aquarius are Saturn (alongside Capricorn), and Uranus. The opposite sign of Aquarius is Leo.

# Myth

The water carrier represented by the constellation Aquarius is Ganymede, a beautiful Phrygian youth. Ganymede was the son of Tros, king of Troy (according to Lucian, he was also the son of Dardanus). While tending to his father's flocks on Mount Ida, Ganymede was spotted by Zeus. The king of gods fell in love with him and flew down to the mountain in the form of a large bird, whisking Ganymede away to the heavens. Ever since, the boy has served as cupbearer to the gods. Ovid has Orpheus sing the tale in his Metamorphoses.
