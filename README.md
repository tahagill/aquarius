## 'World class' Saka leading the way

Key to Arsenal's impressive displays and results in 2024 has been the form of Bukayo Saka.

The England forward scored the Gunners' third goal to take his tally for the season to 16 in all competitions.

It was also the fifth Premier League game in a row he has scored in, while he has also hit two doubles during that run - in the 6-0 win at West Ham and 5-0 victory at Burnley.

"Those moments are what are propelling him forward to be a world-class player one day," added Ferdinand.

"He is a fantastic young player with a brilliant mindset and this is why he is producing on a consistent basis."

Asked about being referred to as "world class", Saka said: "No comment.

"I am happy with another goal today and more importantly happy to win.

"I am working hard every day and giving my best. Obviously I have great team-mates giving me good passes, which helps as well.

"We have been working hard and there is a lot of quality going forward, and it is starting to click now - we just need to continue with this [form]."
